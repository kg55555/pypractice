#User Input and While Loops

The input function pauses and program and prompts
the user to enter a response.

Output will be a string, so convert it with 
*int()*

    variable = input("message")
    
If your message is long, use a variable to 
concatenate strings

##While Loops

    while *condition is true*:
        *code*
        
        
    break continue
   
Use the keyword *break* to immediately exit a
while loop at any point

Use the keyword *continue* to restart the loop
at the top from any point
