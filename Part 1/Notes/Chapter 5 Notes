#IF Statements
Conditional tests that only pass if they
evaluate to true

    if *conditional test*:
        *Run some code*
    elif *conditional test*:
        *Run some code*
    else:
        *Run some code*
        
They don't need to have an else statement at the end

Use the keywords *and* *or* to include
multiple conditions

Use *not* to indicate the opposite

Can be used to check if a value is in a list

        if 'value' not in list_maker:
        
A non-empty list/dictionary/etc returns true,
else it's false
