#Dictionaries

    dictionary_maker = {'key':'value'}
    
Dictionaries store key-value pairs, and values 
can be accessed by inputting the key

    dictionary_maker['key']
    
Add new pairs by assigning them
    
    dictionary_maker['new_key'] = value
    
Delete by using the *del* keyword

    del dictionary_maker['new_key']
  
Use the .get()  method to return a default value
if the key does not exist. Default of default
is None
    
    dictionary_maker.get(key, default)
    
##Looping Through a Dictionary

Returns both key and value

    for k, v in dictionary_maker.items():
    
Return key only

    for k in dictionary_maker:
    for k in dictionary_maker.keys():
    
Return values only

    for v in dictionary_maker.values():
    
Can wrap a *sorted()* method around the dictionary
to process it in a specific order

Wrap a *set()* around a list with duplicates
to create a set with only the unique entries

##Nesting

Can nest a list inside a dictionary and vice versa
Also can nest a list in list and a dictionary
inside another dictionary.

Take care to not next too deeply, as it means that
there is probably an easier way to do it
