# Variables and Simple Data Types

## Variable creation

Variables names can only have letters, numbers,
and underscores.

They cannot start with a number, nor have spaces

Multiple assignment is possible

    x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

## Strings

Anything encased by "" or '' becomes a string.
Both of the notations can be used to add
apostrophes/quotes

.title() .upper() .lower() methods can be
used to manipulate the output of a string

f-strings (format) can be used to display 
variables in strings. End attribute can be
set to anything, default is \n

    print(f"{variable_name}", end="")

Add whitespace (non-printing character) with:

    \t - tab

    \n - newline

Strip excess space with

    .strip() .rstrip() .lstrip()

## Numbers

    + - / * %

    ** represents an exponent

Any division results in a float answer, and 
operations with floats result in float answers

Use int() and str() methods to convert

Python ignores _ in numbers, i.e. 14_000_00

### Constants
Python has no constants, but a good convention
is to make the variable name all caps to indicate
that it should not be changed
