#Working with Lists
## Looping Through Lists

    for magician in magicians:
    
        print(magician)
    
Indent following lines to put it within the loop

##List Methods

range(start, <end, skip) - cycles through numbers
from start to end-1 inclusive. Defaults to 0
and can skip numbers with the third entry

min(list) - finds the lowest value

max(list) - finds the maximum value

sum(list) - sums the list

    squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]
    print(squares) 
    
List comprehensions can be used to generate a
predefined list

##Slice

Take only a range of values from a list

    list_maker[start:end, skip]

Includes values from *start* to *end-1*, and
can accept a value to skip within that range

    [:] - everything
    [1:] - index to end
    [:3] - start to index
    [-3:] - index to end
    
Shallow copy a list by directly assigning to
another variable. Changes in one will be
reflected in the other as they point to the 
same memory location

    list_maker = [.....]
    list_new = list_maker

Deep copy a list with a slice encompassing
everything
    
    list_maker = [.....]
    list_new = list_maker[:]
    
##Tuples
Unchangeable lists

    tuple_maker = (value,)

Created with (), and must have a comma even
with one value

Tuples cannot be modified, but the variable
can be overwritten
